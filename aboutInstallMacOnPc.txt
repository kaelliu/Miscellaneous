# we want to install mac on intel based pc,here is what i do
1.u must have a mac first,u must have a usb driver for more than 16gb
2.download image of lion for install,put the install xxx osx to Application folder
3.in disk utility,change usb driver as Master Boot Record,and partition it for boot
4.download unibeast from tonymacx.com and run it to make the boot driver use the usb driver you just make
5.on pc ,boot with usb hdd,and run and install it,the first step would partition the hard disk
  1).can not take more than 1TB hard driver on lion,so make it small
  2).if can not boot,change sata to use achi mode in bios configure,this is important,keep and save for future
6.install over and reboot,u will see some first configure ,do them ,and use multibeast to do the boot configure,or you will not able to boot without your usb driver
  1).check your motherboard's model,and download your dsdt from tonymacosx.com ,down the base version is better for it,such as my mother board is gigabyte p61
  2).in multibeast,use easybeast installtion,and select use dsdt,and most important is three option under Drivers & Bootloaders,select drivers/Miscellaneous/elliottForceLegacyRTC,EvOreboot,FakeSMC
  ,and also select bootloaders/ and install them,reboot your system,check out whether it can boot without the usb driver
7.make sure your graphics card is be driven correctly.or u need use dvi and hdmi for connect to monitor,VGA may not work correctly.
8.check http://www.tonymacx86.com/61-unibeast-install-os-x-mountain-lion-any-supported-intel-based-pc.html for more detail
p.s.it actually boot slow in pc
