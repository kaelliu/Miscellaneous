2).shared memory access should lock part of memory not all/ or avoid as less as shared memory -done
3).load/balance thread control,see nginx worker process control write/read for example
3.memcached layer should not limit in sql query.but customize by your program logic,and 
do not do double write operation(cached+db),dirty data should flush to db as priority at 
certain time,very important data should write Immediately - done
4.heart beat package added(s-needed/c-optional) ,for avoid client lost connection by unstopable forces -done
5.huge data send solution way,exceed 65535 bytes for example,or over thread stack size exception
1).increase socket send buffer -- not a good way
2).send by splited small package -- pack/unpack solution should added by se

4).paged send some part of data,not all
6.protocolbuf/pure byte protocol added to decrease package size - pb done
