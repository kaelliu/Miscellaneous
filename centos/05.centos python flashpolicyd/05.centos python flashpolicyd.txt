A.python
1.if your centos is above 6 and python version is over 2.6,just go to section B
2.in centos 5,the python in system is 2.4,but do not uninstall 2.4 because a lot of program is depend on it,i just add 2.7 by source code,
and let 2.4 and 2.7 stay together
1).download python
wget http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/Python-2.7.2.tgz
2).tar jxvf Python-2.7.2.tgz
cd Python-2.7.2
./configure
make && make install
the 2.7 will be install in /usr/local/lib/python2.7
you can check version by /usr/local/bin/python2.7 -V
3).make Symbolic link make python point to python2.7,but yum is still base python2.4
mv /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/python.bak (or rm -rf /usr/bin/python)
ln /usr/local/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python
p.s symbolic link is a link that when you operate this file,it will operate the real file which it point to,but when you delete the symbolic
link file,will no delete the file which it point to
4).repair yum
vim /usr/bin/yum
change the first line:#!/usr/bin/python to #!/usr/bin/python2.4 and it will works

B.flash policyd
1.flash web game use socket will need a policyd file such as crossdomain.xml which contains message of allowed port,i use python to listen
on port 843 for flash policy file
2.in centos,just run the script in same folder,it have four file
install.sh -- for install file to place
flashpolicyd.py -- the main runner of program
flashpolicyd.init -- the script as service in centos,see redis part's service script
flashpolicy.xml -- the config file for your allow port
3.run install.sh and will be a service for flash policy
